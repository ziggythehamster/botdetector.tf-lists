# botdetector.tf Lists

Lists and rules for [botdetector.tf](https://botdetector.tf)

## Installation

Download the repository ZIP, extract the JSON files to your botdetector.tf `cfg` directory. The rules will automatically update from then on.

## Contributing

I accept PRs and issues with new players/rules to add, but they must be substantiated. You can attach screenshots to a PR/issue, link to someone's inventory, etc.

### Good candidates for making the list

* Aimbots
* Adbots
* Racists, transphobes, homophobes

### Bad candidates for making the list
 
* Is a better player
* Is a worse player
* Said something shitty once but does not do so pathologically
* Didn't ban a bot
* Voice spam (when not actually a bot), but this is situational. A player who sits at spawn and only voice spams is a candidate.

## Why mark transphobes/homophobes/racists?

TF2 is a game that has stood the test of time mostly because of its amazing community, and there is no place for people who use hate speech in our community. There should be no place for people who use hate speech in _any_ community, but it's ultimately up to Valve to be the moderator of content on all of its platforms.
